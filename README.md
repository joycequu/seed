This is part of the freshman year Weblab class project, website SEED, that @elearnorxyli and I worked on. 

Utilizing MERN, we built a web app from scratch that allows nature enthusiasts to share pictures of plants and nature through images and words and explore greenery in nearby places with location filters.
